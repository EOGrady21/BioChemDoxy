Gordana, I frequently add Q flags even before I do the first run-through of the QC program. This occurs 
when problems were noted during the collection or analysis step. For example, if the field notes say 
“sample order maybe mixed up”, I will put a QC=7, to alert me to recheck when the file is compiled. Lab 
analysis people will also often identify what they consider bad data before I get the files, so I keep would 
add flags to reflect this.

This is great, thank you both.  As I understand if you are processing mission for the first time then it does 
not matter if you say ‘y’ or ‘n’ (I was answering ‘n’ all along).  The answer to the question matters only if 
you are reprocessing QC-ed mission that already has flags. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks again, Gordana

Gordana, 

The QC batch file includes a function called B_setQto1. If you remove that call, you would get no more 
question. But, we sometimes add QC flags by hand and set them in between calls to B_setQto1 and 
B_control_Q. You then have the choice to use them or not.

You might as well need to reprocess a QCed mission.

Hi Laure and Caroline,

When I run QC script it is asking me following;

The Q quality flags already exist. Do you want to reset them to 1? (y or n) ->

In my input files I don’t have any columns for flags, just columns with data.  So I was wondering why is 
the script asking me that, and what is the difference if I say y or n, as there are no flags in the input file 
anyway?

Hi Caroline,

I flagged all our AZMP data using IML Matlab toolbox and now I am looking at the results. I was trying to 
load  to R QC_data*.txt files which are semi-column separated and ran into problems. In some cases 
there are additional semi-columns in the “Test failed”  column (see highlighted in blue below). I was 
wondering if you could tell me which Matlab script writes out that file so I can adjust it.

I just thought of that: there is another time when I use QC=7. When compiling the dataset (BEFORE the 
QC step), if for some reason I doubt a data value (e.g., a note in the analysis file “maybe problem with 
this value”, or  from the field notes “bottle sampling order may be mixed up”), I will set the flag to 7 
(others at 0). Then I let the QC do its work and I can re-examine the value within the context of the 
whole dataset.

Subject: RE: Matlab bottle data QC scripts

flag 7: The procedure sets QC=7 for “constant profile” (i.e., when all values of the variable are the same 
for the profile) or when there is a difference between the CTD-lab pair. You see that you need to be 
warned in either of these situations, and you cannot automatically decide if the data are good or not. 
For example, the water column might be well mixed, so you really do have the same value for all depths; 
OR, maybe the lab analysis person did an autofill of the column by accident. For the CTD-lab pair, you 
could have bad lab data or bad ctd data – you have to determine which. 

surface oxy: You can change the limits for O2 sat (in B_stage_Q_ini.m). The default limits are 85–120%. I 
like the procedure to catch values outside these limits, then I check to see if I disagree. For example, I 
know surface sats can be low in upwelling areas, and I may accept sats >120%, esp if CTD_02 and 
Winklers agree.

Hi Laure and Caroline,

Thank you very much for the detail explanations. This is extremely helpful.  

As it comes to flag 7, I observed that the labo oxy and labo sal are sometimes flagged as 7 if there is a 
systematic  offset from the CTD oxy or CTD sal. Is my observation correct? Sometimes I am not sure why 
is the record  flagged as 7.

I also noticed that surface oxy sometimes gets flagged as 3, probably because it fails the test 2.10 (oxy 
saturation in surface water).  Is this test using some regional values that I would need to adjust?

I am making progress here and I appreciate greatly your support. I am very happy that we will be able to 
make flagging in BioChem more consistent across the regions.

Best regards, Gordana

Hi Gordana, I read down through the email stream between you and Caroline. I have a few comments.

-- description for the column names. The file “description_BTL.docx”  (attached) has the variable codes 
found in the bottle file. I update this file as needed, then I add the variables to data_btl.m for the QC; 
data_dis.m  has the link between the variable codes and BioChem codes. This file is called when creating 
the biochem load tables (I’m not sure you have this, so I’ve sent it).

--How do you QC  “non-standard” parameters (other than T, S, oxy, chl, nutrients)? We use values from 
the World Ocean Database https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD13/ to set our min-max global and 
regional limits for t, s, oxy, chl, nutrients, pH, alk. I used values for the North Atlantic and coastal North 
Atlantic. For other variables, I do a “non-official” QC: compare replicates, look for outliers, check the 
literature for reasonable values. Since these “non-official” tests are not documented, I generally leave 
the QC set at 0, unless the value is crazy and I give it a 3 or 4.

--Do you have any recommendations as how to easily deal with flag #7  No easy way! It can be quite 
tedious. A “7” means the data manager has to go back and look at it to determine a valid flag. I look at 
the value in relation to adjacent values within the profile or with nearby stations. I check if the value is 
near the limits of the climatology polygon or depth range (i.e., would that value be acceptable in the 
neighbouring polygon or next depth interval?). I check if the station is coastal. For O2, surf %sat can be 
high if the sea is agitated. This is an excerpt from the AZMP bulletin article that Caroline and I wrote 
about QC (http://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/365690.pdf) that I find helpful when trying to 
manually set QC flags: 

When faced with anomalous values, a data manager must
consider carefully before assigning quality flags to the data.
Could some real phenomenon have caused the unusual values
(e.g., upwellings, currents, increased freshwater inputs)? Are
there potential anthropomorphic sources that might explain
the values? Are bad instrument calibrations or unstable standards
responsible? A piece of advice sent by a colleague has
always helped guide the first author when she is faced with
a particularly troublesome dataset: “Flagging ‘bad’ points in
datasets is a tricky business. One should always worry about
mislabeling as ‘doubtful’ or ‘erroneous’ data that are interesting
or unusual but real. Good data should take precedence
over expectations of what the numbers should be” (P. Strain,
BIO, pers. comm.).

--Does it mean the CTD data doesn’t get flagged or checked?  We QC the CTD profiles for t, s, sig-t, O2, 
pH. In some cases we use the profile data directly to match with the bottle data (when there is no 
rosette sampling, or when we have noticed that there are problems with upcasts). But generally we use 
the CTD data from the “btl” files produced by the Sea-Bird software (so data from the upcast, when the 
bottles were closed). These files contain a user-specified-sized block of averaged of data (e.g., 10 s at the 
time of bottle trip). You see that we have the variables PRES_SDEV and  TE90_SDEV: I scan through 
these for high values, which could indicate that there was a data spike, or that the bottle wasn’t stopped 
when tripped. If we do a calib for the oxygen or pH sensor, we reconvert the bottle files using the new 
calibration so that these values are good. Finally, the QC package includes a test that compares CTD and 
lab analyses (CTD-sal with autosal; CTD-O2 with Winkler; CTD-fluo with chl; CTD-pH with lab pH). When 
there is a mismatch between the two, I try to determine where the problem lies.

--We created climatology for Scotian shelf for nutrients  I guess you are aware of Petrie et al. 1999 
Nitrate, silicate and phosphate atlas for the Scotian Shelf and GOM (Can Tech Rep Hydrogr Ocean Sci 
203). It is a good idea to update the climatologies with new data. We have been wanting to do this for 
some time now.

Seems like you’re progressing well! That’s great. Good day, Laure

Hi Caroline,

I have your  IML Rosette QC script working fine but I still have few questions:

1.	Is there a function to plot only one profile or you have to run the whole cruise? I was looking at 
B_plot_SOCH(S(i)). CL: You can send only B_plot_SOCH(S(1)) for example. You than have to 
change the value of “i” to see another profile.

2.	Do you have any recommendations as how to easily deal with flag #7? Do you replace it by hand 
and how do you judge what is appropriate flag? CL: Flag 7 is tricky. It is usually changed by hand. 
You should take a look at the B_stage_Q_ini.m file to be sure the parameters are well suited for 
your region. Maybe it isn’t the case. As to know the appropriate flag to replace with, I will let 
Laure answer.

3.	Maps: where did you get bathymetry and coastlines for maps? I saw 2 files gsl_bathy and 
gsl_mask and I was wondering if you by any chance have an equivalent for the Scotian shelf or 
have a function that creates appropriate structure from GEBCO data. CL: I have a map of the 
coastline of east Canada (see attached files). It includes the gulf of St. Lawrence and 
Newfoundland. I don’t have the bathymetry though. The coast is drawn as a bunch of polygons 
but you can include bathymetry easily by adding vectors of constant depth as in the 
gsl_bathy.mat file.

Thank you, Gordana

Hi Caroline,

I have few more questions:

1.	How do you QC  “non-standard” parameters (other than T, S, oxy, chl, nutrients)? Do you have 
some acceptable range of values or did you guys create climatology for those? If there are 
ranges which scripts are they in? Yes, we added pH and alkalinity. Other parameters are not 
QCed yet. The ranges are defined in B_stage_Q_ini.m. Then you must execute the function in 
your rosette toolbox to replace the B_stage*_Q.mat files. The way we determined the ranges is 
described in BOTL_ODF_Quality_en.pdf.

2.	We created climatology for Scotian shelf for nutrients and chl and I was going to replace 
Brickman climatology with our values. (in file Petrie_Nutrents.mat)  I will also have to replace 
boxes. Is there anything else I should worry about changing? If you want to use test 4.2, you 
have to create your own deep water climatology .

3.	For T and S we were going to use Petrie climatology. Does your file for Petrie includes Scotian 
shelf boxes as well or only Gulf boxes? No it doesn’t include the Scotian shelf. See file Petrie.mat 
(box number, box name and lat,lon that are included)

Thank you Caroline. I finally got your bottle QC example working on Matlab 2015a. 

Now I am trying to reformat our data files to match required input and have couple of questions 
regarding example input txt file 'BTL_01064.txt':

1.	Do you have a description for the column names? I see CHL_01 and CHL_03 and was wondering 
what is the difference.  It would be ideal if you have a table mapping the column names from 
the example file to the BioChem data type (METHOD), but any other description would be great. 
CHL_01 and CHL_03 are chlorophyll measurements but obtained using two different methods. 
The description_BTL.docx (French only) contains all the methods we are currently handling. 
However, we are adding methods when needed. The methods are also listed in the data_btl.m 
file (English only) like the CHL_** parameter below

btlLIST(27).name = 'bottle sample chlorophyll content';
btlLIST(27).units = 'mg/m**3';
btlLIST(27).type = 'labo';
btlLIST(27).code = 'CHL_';
btlLIST(27).gf3 = 'CPHL';
btlLIST(27).btl2gf3 = 1;
btlLIST(27).decimal = 2;
btlLIST(27).method = 
{'CHL_01';'CHL_02';'CHL_03';'CHL_04';'CHL_05';'CHL_XX'};
btlLIST(27).desc = {'chlorophyll-a content: fluorometric method of 
Holm-Hansen, Lorenzen, Holmes and Strickland (1965)';...
      'chlorophyll-a content: fluorometric method modified from 
Holm-Hansen, Lorenzen, Holmes and Strickland (1965)';...
      'chlorophyll-a content: Welschmeyer (1994)';...
      'chlorophyll-a content: modified from Welschmeyer 
(1994)';...
      'chlorophylls(a+b+c) content: Richards with Thompson (1952), 
described in Strickland and Parsons (1968)';...
      'chlorophyll-a content: unknown method'};


2.	In your example data file there are multiple columns with the same name. I assume this is to 
accommodate replicates.  Some of the parameters have 2, 3,4, and 5 columns (like NOX_02). 
Does your script require that particular number of columns for each parameter or can I have just 
one column for each parameter if I don’t have replicates? Yes. As many column as replicates. 
You can have only one column.

Any other tips that you might think of would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you , Gordana

I copied all the files that have been updated >=2012 and zipped them. You will notice that there are 
several files with extensions like *.m23sep2013; that’s what we do when we modify a procedure, just in 
case we have to go back to an older version. I left all of these.

Within the zip, you will find another zip named “Rosette.zip” – it looks like we prepared this for 
someone who wanted to set up the QC package; it was created early in 2015. There is a folder in that file 
called “Exemple” with the files you need to run a test example. You can find the series of commands in 
the file B_batch_01064.m. I didn’t check to see if this still works, so let me know if you have any trouble.
